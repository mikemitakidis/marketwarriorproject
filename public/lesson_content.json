It ranges from 0-100 and tells you if a stock is <strong>overbought</strong> (too expensive) or <strong>oversold</strong> (too cheap).</p>\n            \n            <div class=\"highlight-box\">\n                <h4>🎯 How RSI Works (Simple Explanation)</h4>\n                <p><strong>Imagine a rubber band:</strong> When you stretch it too far up (RSI > 70), it wants to snap back down. When you stretch it too far down (RSI < 30), it wants to snap back up.

Identify Patterns & Mistakes</h3>\n            <div class=\"content-box\">\n                <p><strong>You'll discover patterns like:</strong></p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>✅ You trade better in the morning vs. afternoon</li>\n                    <li>✅ Certain setups have higher win rates</li>\n                    <li>❌ You overtrade after a losing streak (revenge trading)</li>\n                    <li>❌ You exit winners too early but hold losers too long</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3>3. Emotional Awareness</h3>\n            <p>Your journal tracks not just <em>what</em> you traded, but <em>how you felt</em>:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Were you confident or uncertain?</li>\n                <li>Did you follow your plan or deviate?</li>\n                <li>What triggered emotional decisions?</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <h3>4. Accountability & Discipline</h3>\n            <p>Writing down every trade creates accountability. You can't lie to yourself when the data is right there!</p>\n\n<h2>📋 What to Record in Your Journal</h2>\n            \n            <div class=\"features-grid\">\n                <div class=\"feature-card\">\n                    <div class=\"feature-icon\">📅</div>\n                    <h4>Trade Basics</h4>\n                    <ul >\n                        <li>Date & Time</li>\n                        <li>Symbol/Asset</li>\n                        <li>Direction (Long/Short)</li>\n                        <li>Position Size</li>\n                    </ul>\n\n<h2>📈 Key Performance Metrics to Track</h2>\n            \n            <h3>1. Win Rate</h3>\n            <div class=\"example-box\">\n                Win Rate = (Number of Winning Trades ÷ Total Trades) × 100%\n                Example: 35 wins out of 50 trades = 70% win rate\n            </div>\n\n            <h3>2. Profit Factor</h3>\n            <div class=\"example-box\">\n                Profit Factor = Total Winning $ ÷ Total Losing $\n                Example: $10,000 in wins ÷ $4,000 in losses = 2.5 profit factor\n                (Above 1.5 is good, above 2.0 is excellent)\n            </div>\n\n            <h3>3. Average Win vs. Average Loss</h3>\n            <div class=\"content-box\">\n                <p><strong>Ideal Ratio:</strong> Average Win should be at least 1.5x your Average Loss</p>\n                <p>If your average win is $300 and average loss is $150, you have a 2:1 ratio ✅</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3>4. Maximum Drawdown</h3>\n            <p>The largest peak-to-trough decline in your account. Keep this under 20% for healthy risk management.</p>\n\n            <h3>5. Expectancy</h3>\n            <div class=\"example-box\">\n                Expectancy = (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)\n                This tells you your average expected return per trade\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <!-- FREE JOURNAL CTA -->\n        <div class=\"journal-cta\">\n            <div class=\"feature-icon\" >🎁</div>\n            <h3>Get Your FREE Professional Trading Journal!</h3>\n            <p>We've created an advanced, web-based trading journal with 8 professional tabs, automatic calculations, and beautiful analytics.
